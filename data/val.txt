<CHAR_GENERAL RIPPER> Do you think they would cheat?
<CHAR_MAJOR MANDRAKE> Look, sir. I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have. Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it. And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.

There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.

<CHAR_MARY> You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
<CHAR_WEBSTER> Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight.

<CHAR_JOEY> How can he embarrass you?
<CHAR_COMO> He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
<CHAR_JOEY> Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
<CHAR_COMO> Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to.

<CHAR_BERNICE> I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.

<CHAR_THE DRAWING-ROOM> Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
<CHAR_THE SICK-ROOM> The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
<CHAR_THE DRAWING-ROOM> Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
<CHAR_THE SICK-ROOM> The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
<CHAR_THE DRAWING-ROOM> Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
<CHAR_THE SICK-ROOM> The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Léone.

<CHAR_SANDY> Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
<CHAR_JEFFREY> Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
<CHAR_SANDY> I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
<CHAR_JEFFREY> Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
<CHAR_SANDY> There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
<CHAR_JEFFREY> Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
<CHAR_SANDY> No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
<CHAR_JEFFREY> The ear is from a missing person maybe?
<CHAR_SANDY> Maybe so.
<CHAR_JEFFREY> It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?

<CHAR_KAY> Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?
<CHAR_MICHAEL> His brother came to help him.
<CHAR_KAY> I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
<CHAR_MICHAEL> On a plane back to Sicily.
<CHAR_KAY> And that's all he had to do. Just show his face.
<CHAR_MICHAEL> That's all. You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one. IF he was a traitor.
<CHAR_KAY> You would have killed his brother?
<CHAR_MICHAEL> Kay, you've got it wrong. That kind of thing's all over, I promised you. This was between the two brothers. Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife. That was his joke, but he meant it. He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook. He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her. He set her up in a house in Jersey. She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life. She begged him to let her go. He did. He gave her money and made her give up the kids. Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.

<CHAR_DANTE> Yeah.
<CHAR_RANDAL> Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
<CHAR_DANTE> It would stand to reason, yes.
<CHAR_RANDAL> Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
<CHAR_DANTE> More or less.
<CHAR_RANDAL> The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.

<CHAR_LELAND> You don't happen to have a cigar, do you? I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking... I changed the subject, didn't I? Dear, dear! What a disagreeable old man I've become. You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane? Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself. He never - gave himself away - He never gave anything away. He just - left you a tip. He had a generous mind. I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions. That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it - But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane. He never had a conviction in his life. I guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant. Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death. But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something. You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
<CHAR_THOMPSON> Sorry, Mr. Leland.
<CHAR_LELAND> Never mind - Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he? Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
<CHAR_THOMPSON> Maybe you could remember something that -
<CHAR_LELAND> I can remember everything. That's my curse, young man. It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race. Memory - I was his oldest friend. As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine. Maybe I wasnt' his friend. If I wasn't, he never had one. Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -

<CHAR_PENELOPE> He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
<CHAR_HAROLD> Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> He's afraid of you, Harold. He knew you'd want to fight him. He doesn't know anything about fighting. He hates pain.

<CHAR_PENELOPE> Blue soup?
<CHAR_HAROLD> An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink. It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge. We laughed, we sang, we snoozed. When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried. We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach! I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"? Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36. All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup! Never stopped drinking blue soup. Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> Sounds quite beautiful.
<CHAR_HAROLD> Beautiful, you say? It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything! Beautiful? Seven years gone-- like that, like that! Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!

<CHAR_GRAHAM> And you feel the same way with John?

<CHAR_WOODWARD> You're not a kid anymore.
<CHAR_BERNSTEIN> My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow." And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper." Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.

<CHAR_MELVIN> It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.

<CHAR_SINDELL> You're still a writer.
<CHAR_PAUL> I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
<CHAR_SINDELL> Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
<CHAR_PAUL> Marcia, please.
<CHAR_SINDELL> No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
<CHAR_PAUL> Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one-time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever. For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
<CHAR_SINDELL> I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi-autobiographical character study.
<CHAR_PAUL> Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? I'm doing this because I have to. Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ... I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.

Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.

Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars?

I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign." I sat there. Five minutes. Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No. I did it. I did it. Like in the old says, Ricky. Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
<CHAR_ROMA> Like you taught me...

<CHAR_CRAIG> There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
<CHAR_MAXINE> Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
<CHAR_CRAIG> He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
<CHAR_MAXINE> What's he been in?
<CHAR_CRAIG> Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.

<CHAR_CONWAY> That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
<CHAR_CHANG> Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
<CHAR_CONWAY> buy and sell?
<CHAR_CHANG> Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
<CHAR_CONWAY> I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
<CHAR_CHANG> That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
<CHAR_CONWAY> Who?
<CHAR_CHANG> A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
<CHAR_CONWAY> When was all this?
<CHAR_CHANG> Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
<CHAR_CONWAY> He amputated his own leg?
<CHAR_CHANG> Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
<CHAR_CONWAY> Well, they didn't actually mean that.
<CHAR_CHANG> Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
<CHAR_CONWAY> Well, is it?
<CHAR_CHANG> Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
<CHAR_CONWAY> 108 and still active?
<CHAR_CHANG> You're startled?
<CHAR_CONWAY> Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
<CHAR_CHANG> Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
<CHAR_CONWAY> Very often.
<CHAR_CHANG> And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
<CHAR_CONWAY> That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
<CHAR_CHANG> Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
<CHAR_CONWAY> I surprise you? Now that's news.
<CHAR_CHANG> I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
<CHAR_CONWAY> Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
<CHAR_CHANG> Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?

<CHAR_UNCLE BILLY> Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
<CHAR_TED> You think we should be more open minded?
<CHAR_UNCLE BILLY> The world is a big, beautiful place. We can open new markets in Africa and Asia. Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.

<CHAR_NOVELLI> That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon. It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.

<CHAR_HAROLD> You don't know you want. That's the way God built you!
<CHAR_PENELOPE> I will not be scrogged. I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
<CHAR_HAROLD> It couldn't!
<CHAR_PENELOPE> I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
<CHAR_HAROLD> Fish can't feel.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> Well, I can. Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me. I'm not a silly carhop any more. Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would. But I've been sensitized. I have ideas now--and solid information. I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
<CHAR_HAROLD> Such as?...
<CHAR_PENELOPE> The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
<CHAR_HAROLD> Tell me about its sexual roots.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted. It's just the truth.
<CHAR_HAROLD> I like the truth. I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
<CHAR_HAROLD> Go on.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> And they have very mixed feelings about women. They hate them in a way. One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently. They can scrog them, as you say-- for revenge.
<CHAR_HAROLD> You learned this in some college course?
<CHAR_PENELOPE> I learned a lot of things in college. Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
<CHAR_HAROLD> The doctor.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> Yes.
<CHAR_HAROLD> And what is his most cherished possession?
<CHAR_PENELOPE> His most cherished possession? His violin, I guess.
<CHAR_HAROLD> And he keeps it in his apartment?
<CHAR_PENELOPE> Yes.
<CHAR_HAROLD> And no one's there now?
<CHAR_PENELOPE> I don't think so.
<CHAR_HAROLD> That's too bad. I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> What are you going to do?
<CHAR_HAROLD> He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me. I'm now going to even that score. I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
<CHAR_PENELOPE> No you're not!

<CHAR_JESSIE> Hello, Gabriel.
<CHAR_GABE> When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
<CHAR_JESSIE> Where've you been?
<CHAR_GABE> Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
<CHAR_JESSIE> Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
<CHAR_GABE> After the funeral I just had to leave.
<CHAR_JESSIE> Had to leave? Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what? We stayed.
<CHAR_GABE> A lot of things fell apart up there.
<CHAR_JESSIE> I know...
<CHAR_GABE> I don't think you do.
<CHAR_JESSIE> Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
<CHAR_GABE> Did I? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line. Maybe I panicked.
<CHAR_JESSIE> I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic. So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt. You held on as long as you could. Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
<CHAR_GABE> I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me. I play it back in my mind everyday.
<CHAR_JESSIE> Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
<CHAR_GABE> I don't expect you to understand.
<CHAR_JESSIE> I don't understand?
<CHAR_GABE> You couldn't.
<CHAR_JESSIE> You're saying, I don't understand? I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand. I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all. Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you. But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
<CHAR_GABE> Why are you yelling?
<CHAR_JESSIE> Excuse me?
<CHAR_GABE> Why are you yelling?
<CHAR_JESSIE> Did I miss something?
<CHAR_GABE> Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
<CHAR_JESSIE> I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
<CHAR_GABE> Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
<CHAR_JESSIE> Resuscitation?
<CHAR_GABE> --mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
<CHAR_JESSIE> Which could maybe what?
<CHAR_GABE> Maybe lead to a flare up...
<CHAR_JESSIE> A flare up...
<CHAR_GABE> Flare up of old emotions...
<CHAR_JESSIE> Listen to you... The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
<CHAR_GABE> From one professional to another, of course.
<CHAR_JESSIE> Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
<CHAR_GABE> No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.

<CHAR_STELLA> Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
<CHAR_TED> Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.

And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.

<CHAR_ZAIUS> You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly. The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there. Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
<CHAR_TAYLOR> I don't know.

<CHAR_PREYSING> No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on...
<CHAR_ZINNOWITZ> You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
<CHAR_PREYSING> Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
<CHAR_ZINNOWITZ> What you need is some relaxation.
<CHAR_PREYSING> Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.

<CHAR_NEO> Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
<CHAR_MORPHEUS> Why?
<CHAR_NEO> I told you I don't believe in this stuff. No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
<CHAR_MORPHEUS> What do you believe in?
<CHAR_NEO> What do I believe it? Are you kidding me? What do you think? I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't. The whole world, my entire life was a lie. I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
<CHAR_MORPHEUS> That's why we're here.
<CHAR_NEO> Why? So I can hear some old lady tell me, what? That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world? Come on. How do I respond to that? I can't. It's ridiculous. I mean who am I? I'm nobody, I'm just a guy. What did I do, Morpheus? Why me?
<CHAR_MORPHEUS> Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots. These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind. I believe them with my heart. In my gut.

<CHAR_VENKMAN> I'm not at liberty to say.
<CHAR_PECK> And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
<CHAR_VENKMAN> In a storage facility.
<CHAR_PECK> And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
<CHAR_VENKMAN> Yes, it would.
<CHAR_PECK> And may I see this storage facility?
<CHAR_VENKMAN> No, you may not.
<CHAR_PECK> And why not, Mr. Venkman?

<CHAR_MOTHER> How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
<CHAR_DADDY> Well, I have a pretty good idea.
<CHAR_MOTHER> If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
<CHAR_DADDY> They follow her because she's a -- -- no, I won't say that.
<CHAR_MOTHER> What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
